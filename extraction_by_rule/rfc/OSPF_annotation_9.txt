         State(s):  Down

            Event:  InterfaceUp

        New state:  Depends upon action routine

           Action:  Start the interval Hello Timer, enabling the
                    periodic sending of Hello packets out the interface.
                    If the attached network is a physical point-to-point
                    network, Point-to-MultiPoint network or virtual
                    link, the interface state transitions to Point-to-
                    Point.  Else, if the router is not eligible to
                    become Designated Router the interface state
                    transitions to DR Other.

                    Otherwise, the attached network is a broadcast or
                    NBMA network and the router is eligible to become
                    Designated Router.  In this case, in an attempt to
                    discover the attached network's Designated Router
                    the interface state is set to Waiting and the single
                    shot Wait Timer is started.  Additionally, if the
                    network is an NBMA network examine the configured
                    list of neighbors for this interface and generate
                    the neighbor event Start for each neighbor that is
                    also eligible to become Designated Router.


         State(s):  Waiting

            Event:  BackupSeen

        New state:  Depends upon action routine.

           Action:  Calculate the attached network's Backup Designated
                    Router and Designated Router, as shown in Section
                    9.4.  As a result of this calculation, the new state
                    of the interface will be either DR Other, Backup or
                    DR.


         State(s):  Waiting

            Event:  WaitTimer

        New state:  Depends upon action routine.

           Action:  Calculate the attached network's Backup Designated
                    Router and Designated Router, as shown in Section
                    9.4.  As a result of this calculation, the new state
                    of the interface will be either DR Other, Backup or
                    DR.


         State(s):  DR Other, Backup or DR

            Event:  NeighborChange


        New state:  Depends upon action routine.

           Action:  Recalculate the attached network's Backup Designated
                    Router and Designated Router, as shown in Section
                    9.4.  As a result of this calculation, the new state
                    of the interface will be either DR Other, Backup or
                    DR.


         State(s):  Any State

            Event:  InterfaceDown

        New state:  Down

           Action:  All interface variables are reset, and interface
                    timers disabled.  Also, all neighbor connections
                    associated with the interface are destroyed.  This
                    is done by generating the event KillNbr on all
                    associated neighbors (see Section 10.2).


         State(s):  Any State

            Event:  LoopInd

        New state:  Loopback

           Action:  Since this interface is no longer connected to the
                    attached network the actions associated with the
                    above InterfaceDown event are executed.


         State(s):  Loopback

            Event:  UnloopInd

        New state:  Down

           Action:  No actions are necessary.  For example, the
                    interface variables have already been reset upon
                    entering the Loopback state.  Note that reception of
